# services

## Getting started
- If you haven't installed Node.js yet, install it
- Clone the repository
- Open it in VSCode
- Install all dependencies via `npm install`
- Execute the command `npm run build`

If the command ran without erros, a folder should have been created named zipped_services containing all zipped servcies. Now you are ready to develop your own services.
